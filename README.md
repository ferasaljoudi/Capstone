- We are developing a driver detection system that alerts when it detects eye closure to prevent drowsiness-related accidents.
- The system uses a camera and a machine learning model running on a Raspberry Pi 5 to monitor the driverâ€™s eye activity in real-time.
- The main goal behind our project is to enhance road safety by offering an affordable, offline solution that reduces accidents caused by drowsy driving.
- Unlike detection systems in expensive high-end cars, our solution is `affordable`, `standalone`, works `offline`, and can be installed in any vehicle, making it more accessible to a broader audience.
