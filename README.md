</div>
<br>

- We are developing a driver detection system that alerts when it detects eye closure to prevent drowsiness-related accidents.
- The system uses a camera and a machine learning model running on a Raspberry Pi 5 to monitor the driver’s eye activity in real-time.
- The main goal behind our project is to enhance road safety by offering an affordable, offline solution that reduces accidents caused by drowsy driving.
- Unlike detection systems in expensive high-end cars, our solution is `affordable`, `standalone`, works `offline`, and can be installed in any vehicle, making it more accessible to a broader audience.

  <summary><b>Implementation Details</b></summary>
  <br>

  Our solution involves using a camera with Raspberry Pi 5 to monitor the driver’s eyes in real-time. We will implement a machine learning model, likely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for accurate eye closure detection, leveraging OpenCV for image processing. The system will sound a buzzer when drowsiness is detected.
